This web application is built using React, Node & Firebase and is based on the SocialApe app ([back end repository](https://github.com/hidjou/classsed-react-firebase-functions), [front end repository](https://github.com/hidjou/classsed-react-firebase-client)) from the [Classed Full Stack React & Firebase tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkBfu-W7tt0&list=PLMhAeHCz8S38ryyeMiBPPUnFAiWnoPvWP) by [Ahmed Hadjou](https://github.com/hidjou)

Tools: React; Firebase; react router dom; firebase
app auth
material ui
express
redux

I cloned the reference repositories and added the current source as client (front-end) and functions (microservices), and added a node .gitignore.
